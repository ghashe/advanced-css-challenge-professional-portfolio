              The first project I took on was a code refactoring. As a student
              at the University of Minnesota Boot Camp, I have completed an
              assignment on code refactoring. After being given a starter code,
              I modified it to complete the challenge based on the requirements,
              the design, the functionality of the web application and the
              acceptance criteria that all the students must meet in order to
              satisfy the scope of work. After reviewing the requirements, the
              design, and functionality of the web application, as well as the
              acceptance criteria presented in various ways that all students
              must meet in order to complete the challenge, I've successfully
              completed the my work on time.

                completed building my own portfolio from scratch. I have
                successfully built a beautiful portfolio based on the
