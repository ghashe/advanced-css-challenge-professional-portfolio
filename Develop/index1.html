              The first project I took on was a code refactoring. As a student
              at the University of Minnesota Boot Camp, I have completed an
              assignment on code refactoring. After being given a starter code,
              I modified it to complete the challenge based on the requirements,
              the design, the functionality of the web application and the
              acceptance criteria that all the students must meet in order to
              satisfy the scope of work. After reviewing the requirements, the
              design, and functionality of the web application, as well as the

              completed the challenge on time.
