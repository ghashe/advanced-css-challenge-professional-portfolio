##Description
t is one of the challenges for developing a responsive web application from the scratch using CSS, HTML, and Git, which is designed to prepare us for scenarios we will likely encounter as a web developer, thereby earning a certificate as a full stack web developer from the University of Minnesota by 2022.

I improved an existing site's HTML and CSS code to make it more accessible without changing what it does and hosting it on Github.
